# CF7 to Telegram
## Description
A simple WordPress plugin that sends Telegram notifications when a Contact Form 7 (CF7) form is successfully submitted. I built this as a personal tool to integrate CF7 with Telegram, allowing me to select a form, set a chat ID, and customize notification templates with form data and emojis. Itâ€™s lightweight, free, and fully customizableâ€”no need for paid alternatives!
